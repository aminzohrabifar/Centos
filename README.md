<b>Customize your MOTD (welcome message) login message in Linux</b>
<br>
folder: motd<br>
This is a little guide to display dynamic login messages on a Linux system.

This is one of those things where the internet has plenty of resources, but they are mostly outdated and contradictory. Even typing man motd in Linux is a sad experience.

It is not a difficult thing to do but it can be a big waste of time to sort out the contradictions.

Hopefully, this post will help get the big picture from one single place.
